Visual Description\nThe video begins with a yellow, watercolor-style animation of the map of Delhi against a light beige background, with the National Geographic logo in the corner. The scene transitions to a search bar interface where a cursor considers the options \"DELHI\" and \"NEW DELHI.\" After suggesting they are \"ONE AND THE SAME THING,\" a large red \"NO\" symbol appears, negating the idea. This is followed by an animation of a confused-looking man with question marks. A vibrant collage then appears, featuring a tiger, Rashtrapati Bhavan, Indian currency, a medal, and Rabindranath Tagore, with the title \"KYC KNOW YOUR COUNTRY.\" The video concludes by showing the map of Delhi again, now labeled \"Delhi, National Capital Territory of India,\" with the Yamuna River highlighted in blue along its eastern border.\n\n### 2. Audio Content\nA female narrator speaks in Hindi throughout the clip. She starts by posing the question: \"What is the capital of India? Delhi? Or were you thinking New Delhi?\" She suggests that people might think they are the same thing but then emphatically states that they are not. Acknowledging the common confusion, she introduces a segment to explain the difference. The segment is introduced with a jingle and the title \"KYC - Know Your Country.\" The narrator then begins her explanation by stating that Delhi is a Union Territory of India.\n\n### 3.

Audio Content\nThe audio is a narration in Hindi. The narrator explains that the story of Delhi is long and will become even more complicated.
