Visual Description\nThe video displays a static whiteboard-style image featuring a hand-drawn diagram of a multi-layer neural network and several mathematical formulas. The neural network consists of an input layer with four nodes (x1 to x4), a first hidden layer with three nodes (h11, h12, h13), a second hidden layer with two nodes (h21, h22), and a final output node (h31) leading to the prediction (ŷ).

She discusses how to calculate the derivative (gradient) of the loss function with respect to the network's weights. She explains that the calculation depends on how a particular weight affects the final output. She first points to weights in the last layer, noting that they each affect only a single output path. She then contrasts this by pointing to a weight in an earlier layer, explaining that it influences multiple paths and therefore affects multiple subsequent outputs, which complicates the derivative calculation.

She explains how to calculate the derivative of the loss function with respect to a specific weight in an earlier layer (e.g., `w11²`). The speaker details the application of the chain rule, explaining that since the process is backpropagation, the calculation must start from the final output and work backward through the network. She breaks down the derivative calculation, showing how a change in a single weight affects the outputs of subsequent layers and, ultimately, the final loss.\n\n### Key Events\n1.  **Initial Setup:** The video begins by showing a diagram of a neural network along with the formulas for the loss function, gradient descent, and the chain rule for calculating gradients.\n2.  **Explaining the Chain Rule:** The speaker explains how to calculate the derivative of the loss (dL) with respect to a specific weight (`dW11²`) using the chain rule, as shown in the red formula.\n3.  **Illustrating Backpropagation:** The concept of backpropagation is verbally explained and visually reinforced with a blue arrow appearing on the diagram, indicating the process of moving backward from the final output to calculate the error gradient.\n4.  **Step-by-Step Calculation:** The speaker details the components of the chain rule, explaining that one must first find the derivative of the loss with respect to the next layer's output (`dO31`), then that output's derivative with respect to the subsequent one (`dO21`), and so on, until reaching the weight in question.\nTime 04:00 - 04:30: Here is a comprehensive summary of the video frames and audio.\n\n**1.

The speaker introduces the problem of updating a weight (`w11²`) deep within the neural network.\n2.  They explain the chain of influence: the weight `w11²` affects the output of its node `O21`, which in turn affects the final output `O31`, and consequently the loss `L`.\n3.  The speaker presents the chain rule formula as the method to calculate the derivative of the loss with respect to the weight (`∂L/∂w11²`).\n4.  They explain that the formula is a product of the derivatives of each link in this chain of influence (`∂L/∂O31`, `∂O31/∂O21`, etc.).\n5.
